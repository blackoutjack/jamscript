A version with debugging symbols can be built by altering the
.mozconfig file, rebuilding (in a directory that is segregated from
the release version) and run as follows. (See doc/INSTALL.bash for the
definition of environment variables that are referenced here.)
 
mv $JAMSCRIPTPKG/ff-dev/mozilla-$VERSION/mozconfig-debug $JAMSCRIPTPKG/ff-dev/mozilla-$VERSION/.mozconfig

./obj-debug/dist/bin/firefox -no-remote -jsconsole

It's also recommended (especially if attaching a debugger) that you
disable the script timeout by going to about:config in the Firefox
address bar and setting the |dom.max_script_run_time| setting to 0.
