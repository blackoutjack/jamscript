This file describes how to apply the JAMScript patches to Firefox
17.0.5esr obtained through the /usr/ports system on FreeBSD 9.0.
Hopefully the steps for 17.0.3esr should be identical (save for 
obtaining the port itself) since it worked that way in Ubuntu.

0) Obtain the www/firefox port and the www/firefox-esr ports for
FreeBSD. You can work in the /usr/ports directory, or if you want
to copy them to an isolated directory, they need to both be within a
parent directory called www.

1) In the commands shown, we'll assume the following environment
variables point to the checked-out JAMScript repository root and
the top of the firefox-esr port directory, respectively.

  JAMSCRIPTPKG=/path/to/jamscript
  FIREFOXESRPORT=/path/to/www/firefox-esr

2) Extract and patch the firefox-esr files. You may need to use sudo.
  
  cd $FIREFOXESRPORT && make extract && make patch

3) Apply all patches. If the port directory is owned by root, you'll
need to add sudo in front of the patch command.

  cat $JAMSCRIPTPKG/patch/*.patch | patch -d $FIREFOXESRPORT/work/mozilla-esr17 -p1

4) JIT is now supported, so there is no need to disable it.

5) Build the browser with make in the top directory for the port. (I
haven't yet determined how to rebuild when files are changed. Running
make again doesn't seem to recognize changes.)

  cd $FIREFOXESRPORT && make

6) If built successfully, you can run the browser as follows.

  ./work/mozilla-esr17/obj-release/browser/dist/bin/firefox

You can also find the js shell at the following location. It is good
for playing around with how transactions behave and is used by the 
automated test suite found in ./tests/run.py.

  ./obj-release/browser/dist/bin/js
